# Finance Models Repository

Welcome to my **Finance Models** repository! 🚀 This is a curated collection of financial models I’ve developed as I've worked on different finance topics.

## 📊 **Overview**

This repository includes models and tools for:
- **Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)**: Forecasting revenue, expenses, and cash flow.
- **SaaS Metrics**: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), Payback Period, etc.
- **Scenario Planning**: Sensitivity and scenario analysis for strategic decision-making.
- **Startups**: 3-statement models, unit economics, and KPI dashboards.
